# Evolution-Cellular-Automata

Lotka Volterra model of species population with added parameters for fitness and mutation. Made with P5 JS. 

This project used Cellular Automata and the Lotkaâ€“Volterra equation to model evolution. 
We used the model get to understand how mutability affects the spread of advantageous genes through a species. 
P5 JS was used to create an interactive model, and additional JS and Excel were used to process the data that the model produced. 
The interactive model lets us gain an intuitive understanding of the system. 
The data was compiled from hundreds of runs of the simulation and let us see large trends that weren't visible from individual runs. 

An interactive demo is hosted [here](https://www.andrewfdunstan.com/code/evolution-ca)
